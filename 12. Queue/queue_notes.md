# Queue
 Queue is also a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO) which means that the element which is inserted first in the queue will be the first one to be removed from the queue.

 Operations on queue:
   - enqueue: adds an item
   - dequeue
   - front
   - rear

 Applications:
  - CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
  - When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes.Examples include IO Buffers,
