# Dynamic Programming
 It is an optmisation over plain recursuion. The idea is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when they are **overlapping subproblems**. It is of two types:
  - Top Down(Memorisation): write recursion solution and memorise overlapping subproblems, easy to implement but slower
  - Bottom up (Tabulation): faster than memorisation generally
