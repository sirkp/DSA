# Matrix
 - Order of a matrix = No. of rows × No. of columns, 
 Eg = A =[[1,2], [3,4]], order(A) = 2*2 

## Properties of transpose
 - (A')' = A

 - (A+B)' = A' + B'

 - (AB)' = B'A'

## Properties of addition and multiplication
 - A+B = B+A

 - (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)
 
 - AB ≠ BA
 
 - (AB) C = A(BC)
 
 - A(B+C) = AB+AC

## Termologies
 - **Symmetric**: A' = A
 
 - **Skew-Symmetric**: A' = -A
 
 - **Diagonal matrix**: A diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero.
 
 - **Orthogonal Matrix**: AA' = A'A = I, I is Identity Matrix
 
 - **Idemponent Matrix**: A^2 = A
 
 - **Involutary Matrix**: A^2 = I
 
 - **Singular Matrix**:|A| = 0

## Notes
 - Every Square Matrix can uniquely be expressed as the sum of a symmetrix matrix and skew symmetric matrix. A = 1/2 (AT + A) + 1/2 (A - AT).

 - Trace of a matrix: trace of a matrix is denoted as tr(A) which is used only for square matrix and equals the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. For example: 

 - Generally 2D array are stored as row major form
