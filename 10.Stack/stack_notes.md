# Stack
 The Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
 It supports 4 operations: push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty()

 Stack can be implemented by array or linked list:
   - The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
   - linked list requires extra space for pointers while array doesn't.
 
 Applications of stack:
   - Stacks can be used to check for the balancing of paranthesis in an expression.
   - Infix to Postfix/Prefix conversion.
   - Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
